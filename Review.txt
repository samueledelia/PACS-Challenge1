README could be improved a bit.
  - specify more information on the parameters.pot file.
  - make the overall README a bit more verbose.
  - last comments are irrelevant: clearly if I want to recompile, I can just clean and recompile.


Why do you have a chunk of code in the main that is useless? Where you "copy" each parameters.

Why do you have a make.dep file?

Although employing smart pointer could be appreciated to instanciate all the parameters and so on, I think that for handling parameters there is no need to be so much sophisticated.

Maybe an enumclass would have been more elegant

while(true) is not a good coding practice!!

ADAM and AdaMax where also implemented. Nice!

Overall, good job. I can see you made a lot of commits and hard work!
